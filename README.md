# EntityFrameworkMVCDemo

A quick technical demo of an ASP.NET MVC project using Entity Framework for database generation and access.

To use this, create a ASP.NET MVC application using .NET Framework 4.5.2. Keep the standard user authentication option to have Entity Framework baked in.

After creating the project, overwrite the directories.

# Notes

* I named my sample ASP.NET application "EFWeb". The Album model was named Album.cs, and I named an Album controller as AlbumsController.cs. There is also an Albums folder in the Views section; default scaffolding was used to handle CRUD operations for the Album table. Other than that, I'm aware of no other special parameters or packages.

* At the time, the Entity Framework version used was 6.1.1.
